description: "Each of TriAmp Mark 3's six independent, action-packed channels represents a whole era of tone, and each of these six eras can be routed to three independent tube power amps. But there's more. You can also combine two or even all three of the power amps, merge different power amp characters, and play TriAmp Mark 3 with up to 150 watts of sheer tube power."
