First I would define it as a climbing action game, climbing being the...main activity.

Beautiful graphics, great story telling, mesmerising atmosphere, sumptuous audio, yet a terrible gameplay. I cannot emphasis how disappointing it is. The game mecanics are as old as CrashBandicoot \[wink\* wink\*\] and completely outdated...Basically we haven't evolved since God of War.  
In terms of raw gameplay, it has been, once again, dumbed down to please the little capricious. Why not go with something enjoyable like "shadows of mordor" for example?
